# Papers on Language

- This repo was long due which consists all my **re-implementations of various papers in Natural Language Processing** that I read during the last few years.

- All papers follow this structure:
  * **Paper Name**
    - **Original Paper**
    - **Code Reimplementation**: **Using PyTorch/Tensorflow**(both in most papers)
    
- This repo will be updated once every month.
